Our team's objective is to address the heart disease problem in Singapore, by predicting the possibility of a person getting heart diasease as well as advices to prevent getting heart disease.

Entire Codebase Sequence

1.Brief introduction to the dataset
2.Import necessary modules
3.Basic pre-processing of the dataset (E.g. Definition of variables in the dataset, Checking for null values, etc. )
4.Correction of errors in the dataset (E.g. Wrong data inputs, Duplicates, etc.)
5.EDA (Both numeric and Categorical variables) + Data-driven insights
6.Machine learning models (5 models in total: Linear regression, Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, Perceptron)
7.Analysis and evaluation (Incorporated within ML models)
8.Data-driven Insights + Recommendations (Incorporated within our entire codebase)
