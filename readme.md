### Motivation
Heart disease is a prevalent issue and severely impacted our lives. This can also be seen from statistics provided by Singapore Heart Foundation that 23 people die from heart disease everyday. 

### Objective
Our team aims to address the heart disease problem in Singapore by predicting the likelihood of a person developing heart disease and providing preventive measures.
